    <h1>1. GST guide: </h1>                                                                  

<p>The Goods and Services Tax is a taxation system in India introduced by the Government on 1st July 2017. The main idea behind the implementation of GST was “one nation, one tax”, GST abolishes multiple layers of taxes such as VAT, Service Taxes, Sales Tax etc  and integrates all of these taxes under a single indirect tax.<br><br>

    The basic purpose was to reduce the burden of tax on the common taxpayers of India. The Central Government as well as the State Government impose taxes on goods and services, known as IGST or CGST and SGST respectively.<br><br></p> 

<h3>Why do you need GST To start an online business?</h3>

<p>It is mandatory for all the online sellers or online businesses to have a GST registration. The taxes have been reduced though. The companies with turnovers less than ₹20 lakh do not have to pay GST. All the businesses which are being executed online, have to register for GST.<br><br>

    Online sellers need to file monthly returns and pay taxes on the required transactions.<br><br>
    </p>
